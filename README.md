# movieScraper

1. Goes through the movie database website searching for movies to add to my database.

2. The program only adds movies that reach a certain criteria so the searches do not have random movies that nobody has heard of.

3. I had the program filter the results into 3 categories. 

  -Movies to add to the database
  
  -Movies that are almost popular enough that I will go through later
  
  -Movies that are very unpopular or that return invalid results

4. I will then go through the lists and see if any of the almost piles I would like to add to the list.
